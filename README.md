SIESTA is a wake/sleep based online continual learning algorithm and designed to be computationally efficient for resource-constrained applications such as edge devices, mobile phones, robots, AR-VR and so on. It is capable of rapid online learning and inference while awake, but has periods of sleep where it performs offline memory consolidation.
